<h1>SkillConnect</h1>

The SkillConnect Platform is designed to bridge the gap between skilled individuals looking to share their expertise and those eager to learn new skills. By leveraging geographic proximity, this platform aims to facilitate connections and provide accessible educational opportunities for all members of society. Built using the MERN stack, this user-friendly website aggregates information on skilled individuals willing to offer teaching services and connects them with learners based on their interests and location.
